Password Cracking and Protection Toolkit

This toolkit demonstrates the process of cracking weak passwords and provides guidance on protecting against common password vulnerabilities. It is an educational project designed to teach interns and beginners about password hashing, brute force attacks, and the importance of strong password policies.

Dictionary Attack Simulation
Simulate a dictionary attack by matching password hashes with common weak passwords.

Brute Force Attack Simulation
Attempt to crack passwords by generating all possible character combinations.

Password Hashing
Demonstrates secure hashing using SHA256 and bcrypt.

Password Policy Enforcement
Enforce strong password rules using the passlib library.

Password Encryption and Decryption
Securely encrypt and decrypt passwords using AES encryption with the cryptography library.


Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python

Libraries:
bcrypt: For secure password hashing.
passlib: For enforcing password policies.
cryptography: For AES encryption and decryption.
Hashing Algorithms: SHA256 (via Pythonâ€™s hashlib) and bcrypt.
